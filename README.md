Bank and Polling Station Challenges

The project has two parts.  

Bank:
A very basic financial data csv titled "budget_data.csv" containing a campany's Date and Profit/Losses is used to the financial records of the company.  In this exercise a Python script is used to calculate, return, and write a few data points for the company:

The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period.
Calculate the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period. 
The average of the changes listed above.
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Polling Station:
Utlizing a data file called election_data.csv which is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate; a Python script is written to analyze the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast.
A complete list of candidates who received votes as well as the percentage and total number of votes they each won.
The winner of the election based on popular vote.

A couple notes:
Pandas could have been utilized to more easily populate several of the data points above.
Most financial and election records would have contained far more data, and therefore could have provided a much broader picture of the situations.
